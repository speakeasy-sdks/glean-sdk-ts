        # Introduction
        In addition to the data sources that Glean has built-in support for, Glean also provides a REST API that enables customers to put arbitrary content in the search index. This is useful, for example, for doing permissions-aware search over content in internal tools that reside on-prem as well as for searching over applications that Glean does not currently support first class. In addition these APIs allow the customer to push organization data (people info, organization structure etc) into Glean.

        # Usage guidelines
        This API is evolving fast. Glean will provide advance notice of any planned backwards incompatible changes along
        with a 6-month sunset period for anything that requires developers to adopt the new versions.

        post:
            summary: Schedules the processing of uploaded documents
            description: |
                Schedules the immediate processing of documents uploaded through the indexing API. By default the uploaded documents will be processed asynchronously but this API can be used to schedule processing of all documents on demand.

                If a `datasource` parameter is specified, processing is limited to that custom datasource. Without it, processing applies to all documents across all custom datasources.
                #### Rate Limits
                This endpoint is rate-limited to one usage every 3 hours. Exceeding this limit results in a 429 response code. Here's how the rate limit works:
                1. Calling `/processalldocuments` for datasource `foo` prevents another call for `foo` for 3 hours.
                2. Calling `/processalldocuments` for datasource `foo` doesn't affect immediate calls for `bar`.
                3. Calling `/processalldocuments` for all datasources prevents any datasource calls for 3 hours.
                4. Calling `/processalldocuments` for datasource `foo` doesn't affect immediate calls for all datasources.

                For more frequent document processing, contact Glean support.
